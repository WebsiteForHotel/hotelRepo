//       <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
//       <p>
//         Hello and welcome! We are glad that you are taking the time to read these terms of service (the “Terms”).
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         These Terms are important as they, together with your booking confirmation email (the “Booking Confirmation”),
//         set out the legal terms on which Travel Services are made available to you through our Service. They also cover
//         any interactions or communications you have with us through our Service.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Your use of our Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of these Terms. To book a Travel Service, you must
//         also accept these Terms. If you do not accept these Terms, then please do not use our Service or book a Travel
//         Service.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         We may change these Terms at any time and your future use of our Service following changes to these Terms is
//         subject to you accepting those updated Terms. We recommend that you save or print a copy of these Terms.
//       </p>

//       <h2 className="my-6 text-4xl" >Definitions</h2>
//       <p>
//         In these Terms:
//         <ul>

//           <li>“our Partners” refers to any affiliated, co-branded or linked website through which our Group of Companies provides content or service.</li>
//           <li>“our Service” refers to the provision of our websites, apps and online tools.</li>
//           <li>“Travel Provider” refers to the travel supplier making available the Travel Services to you through our Service.</li>
//           <li>“Travel Services” refers to the travel services made available to you by the relevant Travel Provider(s) through our Service, such as stays at a property.</li>
//           <li>“you” refers to you, the traveller, using our Service or making a booking with our Service.</li>
//         </ul>
//       </p>

//       <h2 className="my-6 text-4xl" >Section 1: Rules and Restrictions</h2>
//       <p>
//         As well as these Terms, other terms and conditions provided by Travel Providers (such as a property’s terms and
//         conditions) also apply to your booking (“Rules and Restrictions”).
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         To make a booking, you must accept the Rules and Restrictions of the Travel Provider that you select (such as
//         payment of due amounts, refundability, penalties, availability restrictions and use of fares or services, etc.).
//         The relevant Rules and Restrictions are provided to you before you make a booking and are incorporated by
//         reference into these Terms.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         If you violate a Travel Provider's Rules and Restrictions, your booking may be cancelled and you may be denied
//         access to the relevant Travel Service. You may also lose any money paid for such booking and we or the Travel
//         Provider may debit your account for any costs we or they incur as a result of such violation.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Travel Providers may either be individuals acting on a consumer to consumer basis, or professionals operating on
//         a business to consumer basis. On our Service we label listings as “private host” or “private supplier” where the
//         Travel Provider has notified us that they are acting in the capacity as an individual (non-professional). If you
//         enter into an agreement with an individual on a consumer-to-consumer basis, please be aware that consumer law
//         will not apply in relation to your contract with the Travel Provider. The Travel Provider is solely responsible
//         for determining whether or not they are operating as a consumer or a business and for any representations they
//         make to you with respect to their status.
//       </p>

//       <h2 className="my-6 text-4xl" >Section 2: Using our Service</h2>

//       <h2 className="my-6 text-4xl" >Section 3: Confirming a booking</h2>
//       <p>
//         Your Booking Confirmation includes the essential elements of your booking, such as the description of the Travel
//         Service(s) booked and the price.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         We will send your Booking Confirmation and any relevant travel documents to the email address you provide when
//         you book. If you do not receive your Booking Confirmation within 24 hours of making your booking, please contact
//         us.
//       </p>

//       <p>
//         If there is an obvious error and you have made a booking, we will offer you the opportunity to keep your booking
//         by paying the correct price or we will cancel your booking without penalty. We have no obligation to make
//         available Travel Services to you at an incorrect (lower) price even after you have been sent a Booking
//         Confirmation, if the error should reasonably have been apparent to you.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Taxes
//         <br />
//         The prices displayed through our Service may include taxes or tax recovery charges. Such taxes or tax recovery
//         charges may include amounts associated with value-added tax, goods and services tax, sales tax, occupancy tax
//         and other taxes of a similar nature.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Taxes or tax recovery charges are generally calculated or estimated on the prices displayed through our Service
//         before any discounts (including those funded by us), coupons and loyalty rewards that may be applicable to your
//         booking, unless those discounts, coupons and loyalty rewards are considered as a reduction in price for the
//         purposes of calculating or estimating taxes in the relevant jurisdiction for the booking.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         In certain jurisdictions, you may be responsible for paying local taxes imposed by local tax authorities (such
//         as city taxes or tourist taxes, etc.). Our Group of Companies or the Travel Provider may charge you such local
//         taxes. Our Group of Companies will notify you of any local taxes that will be payable by you before you complete
//         your booking, where such taxes have been notified to our Group of Companies by the Travel Provider.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         The amount of local taxes can change between the booking date and stay date. If taxes have changed by your stay
//         date, you may be liable to pay taxes at the higher rate.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Payment processing
//         <br />
//         When payment is taken at the time of your booking and paid for in the local currency of our Service (as
//         relevant), the company taking that payment (via third-party payment processors) and charging your payment method
//         will be the company set out next to the relevant location of our Service in the table below.

//       <p>
//         Notwithstanding the governing law and jurisdiction paragraph in Section 15 (General) of these Terms, where one
//         of our companies (as set out in the table above) takes your payment (via third-party payment processors) and
//         charges your payment method, the law governing that payment transaction will be the laws of the location of such
//         company.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Our Privacy Statement provides information on how we use your payment and account information when you elect for
//         us to store a credit or debit card or other payment method for future use.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Payment verification
//         <br />
//         You authorize the relevant company (as set out in the table above) or the Travel Provider to:
//         <ul>
//           <li>verify your payment method by obtaining a pre-authorization, charging a nominal fee or through other verification means, and</li>
//           <li>on verification, charge your payment method.</li>
//         </ul>
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Fees charged by banks
//         <br />
//         Some banks and card issuers impose fees for international or cross-border transactions. For example, if you make
//         a booking using a card issued in a different country from the Travel Provider’s location or you choose to
//         transact in a currency that is different from the local currency of our Service, your card issuer may charge you
//         an international or cross-border transaction fee.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Also, some banks and card issuers impose fees for currency conversion. For example, if you make a booking in a
//         currency different to the currency of your credit card, your card issuer may convert the booking amount to the
//         currency of your credit card and charge you a conversion fee.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your
//         bank or card issuer. Our Group of Companies is not associated or responsible for any fees relating to varying
//         exchange rates and card issuer fees.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Currency conversion
//         <br />
//         Any currency conversion rates displayed on our Service are based on public sources and current exchange rates,
//         which may vary between the time a booking is made and the time of travel. Such rates are provided for
//         information purposes only and, while we seek to provide information that is correct, our Group of Companies does
//         not guarantee the accuracy of such conversion rates because they are not within our control.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Alternative payment methods
//         <br />
//         We may partner with providers of alternative payment methods (such as consumer finance companies), to provide
//         our travellers with alternative payment methods. Our Group of Companies does not endorse or recommend any
//         alternative payment provider or their products or services. Our Group of Companies is not responsible for the
//         content or the acts or omissions of any alternative payment provider. Your use of any such provider’s payment
//         method is at your own risk and will be governed by such provider’s terms and policies.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Fraud
//         <br />
//         If a booking or account shows signs of fraud, abuse, association with a government-sanctioned person or entity,
//         or other suspicious activity, we may request extra information from you.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         If we reasonably conclude that a booking or account is associated with fraud, abuse, a government-sanctioned
//         person or entity or suspicious activity, we may:
//         <ul>
//           <li>cancel any bookings associated with your name, email address or account</li>
//           <li>close any associated accounts, and</li>
//           <li>take legal action, including to seek to hold you liable for any loss.</li>
//         </ul>
//       </p>
//       <p>Please contact us about the cancellation of a booking or closing of an account.</p>

//       <h2 className="my-6 text-4xl" >Section 5: Cancelling or changing a booking</h2>
//       <p>
//         Cancellation or change by you
//         <br />
//         Cancellations or changes (with respect to the travel date, destination, place where the trip starts, property or
//         means of transport) to a booking can be made by contacting us.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         You do not have an automatic right to cancel or change a booking unless allowed by the relevant Travel Provider
//         under their Rules and Restrictions (which are provided to you before you make a booking).
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Travel Providers may charge you fees for cancelling (in full or part) or changing a booking. Such fees will be
//         set out in the Rules and Restrictions. You agree to pay any charges that you incur. Please be aware that for
//         changes, the price of your new arrangements will be based on the applicable price at the time you ask us to make
//         the change. This price may not be the same as when you originally booked the Travel Services. Prices tend to
//         increase the closer to the departure date that the change is made.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Please read the relevant Rules and Restrictions, so you know which terms apply to your booking. For example:
//         <ul>
//           <li>
//             if you book a stay at a property and you do not cancel or change your booking before the relevant
//             cancellation policy period, you may be subject to the cancellation or change charges as shown in the relevant
//             Rules and Restrictions
//           </li>
//           <li>some properties do not permit cancellations of, or changes to, bookings after they are made</li>
//           <li>
//             if you make a Pay Later booking and you do not show up or cancel the booking, the property may impose a
//             no-show or cancellation charge as shown in the relevant Rules and Restrictions and you will be charged the
//             property's no-show or cancellation charge, and
//           </li>
//           <li>
//             if you do not show up or fail to use some or all of the Travel Services booked, refunds may only be due to
//             you in line with the relevant Rules and Restrictions.
//           </li>
//         </ul>
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         If you want to cancel or change any part of a booking and such cancellation or change is allowed by the relevant
//         Travel Provider, then, in addition to any charges imposed by the Travel Provider, we may also charge you an
//         administration fee. If such an administration fee applies, it will be notified to you before you agree to
//         proceed with the change/cancellation.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Other cancellation or change
//         <br />
//         We (and the relevant Travel Provider) may cancel your booking if full payment for the booking, or any applicable
//         cancellation/change charge or fee relating to a booking is not received when due.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         For a variety of reasons (such as a property is overbooked due to connectivity issues or a property is closed
//         due to a hurricane, etc.), it is possible that a booking may be cancelled or changed by the Travel Provider or
//         us. If this happens, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you as soon as possible and offer alternative
//         options/assistance where possible or a refund.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Refund
//         <br />
//         Any refunds will be transferred back to you to the payment method you used to make the original booking. Such
//         refunds will be made by the party that took your original payment. We do not have visibility of a Travel
//         Provider’s refund process. Our fees are not refundable unless this is stated otherwise during the booking
//         process.
//       </p>

//       <h2 className="my-6 text-4xl" >Section 6: Travel Service specific terms</h2>
//       <p>
//         This Section provides details of the terms relevant to the specific Travel Services provided by the Travel
//         Provider. These details are not exhaustive and do not replace the relevant Rules and Restrictions, which are
//         provided to you before you make a booking.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Each Travel Service is subject to the relevant Rules and Restrictions of the Travel Provider. Please also read
//         this Section which will also apply to your booking as applicable. If there is any inconsistency between this
//         Section and the relevant Rules and Restrictions, the relevant Rules and Restrictions prevail.

//         <strong>Deposit</strong>
//         <br />
//         Some Travel Providers require a payment card or cash deposit at check-in to cover extra expenses incurred during

//       <p>
//         <strong>Ratings</strong>
//         <br />
//         Ratings shown through our Service indicate what you might expect from properties displaying that rating level,
//         including (where applicable) through local and national star rating organisations. These may differ from
//         standards in your own country. Site displayed ratings do not represent or promise any particular feature or
//         amenity. Additional information is available in the “Overview” or “Amenities” section of the property details
//         page. These guidelines are subject to change, and our Group of Companies and our Partners cannot guarantee the
//         accuracy of any specific rating displayed from time to time through our Service.

//       <h3>B. Vrbo Holiday Rentals</h3>
//       <p>
//         When you book a holiday rental property distributed through our Service from Vrbo or one of the Vrbo brands
//         (Stayz, Bookabach, FeWo Direkt and Abritel), referred to as a “Vrbo Holiday Rental”, the Vrbo terms and
//         conditions we present to you during the booking process apply to your payment and booking of the Vrbo Holiday
//         Rental.
//       </p>

//       <h3>C. Linked Travel Arrangements</h3>
//       <p>
//         “Linked Travel Arrangement” means the same as the definition of a “linked travel arrangement” in the Directive
//         (EU) 2015/2302 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on Package Travel and Linked
//         Travel Arrangements as implemented into national law (“Directive (EU) 2015/2302”).
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         In certain circumstances and depending on the Travel Services offered from time to time, a Linked Travel
//         Arrangement may be formed as a result of Travel Services you decide to book on or via our Service. Where this
//         possibility arises, you will be directed to read the important information below.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         If, after selecting and paying for one Travel Service, you book additional Travel Services for your trip or
//         holiday via our Service, you will NOT benefit from rights applying to packages under Directive (EU) 2015/2302.
//         Therefore, we will not be responsible for the proper performance of those additional Travel Services. In case of
//         problems please contact the relevant Travel Provider.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         However, if you book a travel service with a third party such as car rental for your trip via a link on the
//         confirmation page or Booking Confirmation not later than 24 hours after receiving the confirmation of the
//         property booking from us, those travel services will become part of a Linked Travel Arrangement. In that case we
//         have, as required by EU law, protection in place to refund your payments to us for services not performed
//         because of our insolvency. Please note that if any of your payments go directly to the relevant Travel Provider,
//         we have not taken out any protection to refund you in the event of the insolvency of the relevant Travel
//         Provider.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         <strong>More information on insolvency protection:</strong>
//         <br />
//         We have taken out insolvency protection with Liberty Mutual Insurance Europe SE (5-7 rue Léon Laval, L-3372
//         Leudelange, Luxembourg). Travellers may contact this entity (Tel: +31 103120666 email:
//         Insolvency-claims@ipplondon.co.uk) if the services are denied because of our insolvency.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Note: This insolvency protection does not cover contracts with parties other than us, which can be performed
//         despite our insolvency.

//       <p>
//         Although most travel occurs without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve more risk than others.
//         You must review any travel warnings/advice, etc. issued by the relevant governments before you book
//         international travel. You should also monitor such travel warnings/advice during travel and before your return
//         journey to help avoid and minimise any potential disruptions.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         You may find travel advice and information on restrictions, entry requirements and the level of risk associated
//         with travel to particular international destinations here. You should make sure you are aware of and comply with
//         applicable advice, restrictions and entry requirements.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         <strong>Health</strong>
//         <br />
//         You should check the recommended inoculations/vaccinations which may change at any time. You should consult your
//         doctor before you depart. You are responsible for ensuring you:
//         <ul>
//           <li>meet all health entry requirements</li>
//           <li>receive the relevant/required inoculations/vaccinations</li>
//           <li>take all recommended medication, and</li>

//       <p>
//         <strong>Passport and visa</strong>
//         <br />
//         You must consult the relevant Embassy or Consulate for passport and visa information. Requirements may change so
//         check for up-to-date information before booking and departure and allow sufficient time for all relevant
//         applications.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Our Group of Companies is not liable if you are refused entry onto a flight or cruise ship (if applicable) or
//         into any country, due to your conduct, including your failure to carry the correct and adequate travel documents
//         required by any Travel Provider, authority or country (including countries you are transiting through). This
//         includes all stops made by an aircraft or a cruise ship (if applicable), even if you do not leave the aircraft
//         or airport or cruise ship.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Passport: You are required to have a valid passport in the country of issue for all holidays offered through our
//         Service.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Some overseas countries have an immigration requirement that your passport is valid for a minimum period after
//         you enter that country, typically 6 months. If your passport is in its final year of validity, you must confirm
//         the requirements of the destination before making final travel plans.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         The name on the passport must match the name on the ticket, otherwise you may not be able to travel and
//         insurance may be invalid. If, after booking a Travel Service but before travelling, any member of your party
//         changes their name (for example, as a result of getting married, etc.), you must notify us.
//       </p>
//       <p>Please visit here for more information regarding passports.</p>
//       <p>
//         Visa: For information on visa requirements, you are advised to contact the Embassy or Consulate of the country
//         you propose to visit, as well as the Embassy or Consulate of the country you wish to return to, if you are not a
//         citizen of that country.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Some governments require airlines to provide personal information about all travellers on their aircraft. The
//         data will be collected either at the airport when you check in or in some circumstances when you make your
//         booking. Please contact the relevant airline you are travelling with if you have any questions about this.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Our Group of Companies does not represent or warrant that travel to international destinations is advisable or

      <h2 className="my-6 text-4xl" >Section 1: Rules and Restrictions</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to these Terms, other terms and conditions provided by
        Travel Providers (e.g., property terms and conditions) apply to your
        booking (“Rules and Restrictions”).
      </p>
      <p>
        To make a booking, you must accept the Rules and Restrictions of the
        Travel Provider you choose (such as amounts payable, refundability,
        penalties, availability restrictions, and the use of fees or services).
        The relevant Rules and Restrictions will be provided to you before you

      <p>
        If you violate a Travel Provider's Rules and Restrictions, your booking
        may be canceled, and access to the relevant Travel Service may be
        denied. You may also lose any money paid, and we or the Travel Provider
        may charge your account for any costs incurred as a result of such
        violation.

      <p>
        Travel Providers may be individuals operating consumer-to-consumer (C2C)
        or professionals operating business-to-consumer (B2C). We label listings
        as “private host” or “private supplier” when the Travel Provider
        indicates they are acting as an individual (non-professional). If you
        enter into an agreement with an individual, please note that consumer
        law may not apply to your contract with the Travel Provider. The Travel
        Provider is responsible for indicating whether they are acting as a
        consumer or business and for any representations made about their
        status.

        those financed by us), coupons, and loyalty rewards are applied.
        Otherwise, these discounts, coupons, and loyalty rewards are not
        considered price reductions for the purpose of calculating or estimating
        taxes in the relevant jurisdiction for the booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some jurisdictions, you may be responsible for paying local taxes
        (such as city taxes or tourist taxes) imposed by local tax authorities.
        Our Group Companies or the Travel Provider may collect these local taxes
        from you. If there are any such taxes reported to us by the Travel
        Provider, our Group Companies will inform you of any local taxes due
        before completing your booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount of local taxes may vary between the booking date and the
        accommodation date. If taxes have changed based on your stay date, you
        may be required to pay the higher rate.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we determine that a booking or account is associated with fraud,
        abuse, a government-sanctioned person or entity, or suspicious activity,
        we may take the following actions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cancel all bookings associated with your name, email address, or
            account
          </li>
          <li>Close the relevant accounts, and</li>
          <li>
            Initiate legal proceedings, including legal actions to hold you
            responsible for losses.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Contact us regarding the cancellation of a booking or the closure of an
        account.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-6 text-4xl" >Section 5: Cancelling or Modifying a Booking</h2>
      <p>
        Your Cancellation or Modification
        <br />
        To cancel or modify a booking (including changing travel dates,
        destination, departure point, property, or mode of transportation),
        contact us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless permitted under the Rules and Restrictions of the relevant Travel
        Provider (which will be provided to you before booking), you do not
        automatically have the right to cancel or modify a booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Travel Providers may charge you fees to cancel (in whole or in part) or
        modify a booking. Such fees are specified in the Rules and Restrictions.
        You agree to pay any fees incurred. For modifications, the price of your
        new arrangements will be determined based on the price applicable on the
        date you request the modification. This price may differ from the price
        when you first booked the Travel Services. Prices generally increase as
        the modification date approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to read the relevant Rules and Restrictions to understand the
        terms applicable to your booking. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you book a property stay and do not cancel or modify your booking
            before the relevant cancellation policy period expires, you may be
            subject to cancellation or modification fees as specified in the
            relevant Rules and Restrictions
          </li>
          <li>
            Some properties do not allow cancellations or modifications after
            booking
          </li>
          <li>
            If you make a Book Now, Pay Later reservation and do not show up or
            cancel the reservation, the property may charge a no-show or
            cancellation fee as specified in the relevant Rules and
            Restrictions, and you may be liable to pay the property's no-show or
            cancellation fee
          </li>
          <li>
            If you do not show up or do not use some or all of the Travel
            Services you booked, you may be entitled to a refund only according
            to the relevant Rules and Restrictions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to cancel or modify any part of a booking and it is
        permitted by the relevant Travel Provider, we may also charge you an
        administrative fee in addition to any fees applied by the Travel
        Provider. If such an administrative fee is applicable, we will inform
        you before proceeding with the modification/cancellation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other Cancellations or Modifications
        <br />
        If full payment for a booking or the cancellation/modification fee or
        charge related to the booking is not received, we (and the relevant
        Travel Provider) may cancel your booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        For various reasons (e.g., a property may be overbooked or closed due to
        a hurricane, etc.), a booking may be canceled or modified by the Travel
        Provider or us. In such cases, we will make reasonable efforts to notify
        you as soon as possible and offer alternative options/assistance or
        refunds.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-6 text-4xl" >Section 6: Specific Conditions for Travel Services</h2>
      <p>
        This Section provides details about the conditions applicable to
        specific Travel Services offered by Travel Providers. These details are
        not exhaustive and do not replace the relevant Rules and Restrictions
        provided to you before booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Travel Service is subject to the relevant Rules and Restrictions of
        the Travel Provider. Please also read this Section, as it will apply to
        your booking. If there is any inconsistency between this Section and the
        relevant Rules and Restrictions, the relevant Rules and Restrictions
        will prevail.
      </p>

      <h3>A. Accommodations</h3>
      <p>
        Our Service may offer you the option to Pay Now or Pay Later. Room rates
        (including applicable taxes and fees) are displayed to you under Pay Now
        and Pay Later payment options through our Service. Taxes and fees may
        vary depending on the payment option you choose. Tax rates and exchange
        rates may change between your booking and accommodation date.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pay Now</strong>
        <br />
        If you choose the Pay Now payment option, the relevant company (as
        specified in Section 4 (Payment)) will usually charge your payment
        method for the booking amount at the time of booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pay Later</strong>
        <br />
        If you choose the Pay Later payment option, the Travel Provider will
        usually charge your payment method in the local currency during your
        stay or as indicated to you during the booking process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Deposit</strong>
        <br />
        Some Travel Providers may require a payment card or cash deposit upon
        check-in to cover any additional charges incurred during your stay. This
        deposit is unrelated to any payments made to the relevant company (as
        specified in Section 4 (Payment)) for your booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>First Night No-Show</strong>
        <br />
        If you do not show up for the first night of your accommodation booking
        but plan to check in for subsequent nights, please contact us before
        your original check-in date. Failure to confirm this may result in the
        cancellation of your entire booking. Refunds for no-shows will only be
        provided according to the property's relevant Rules and Restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Group Bookings</strong>
        <br />
        You may not book more than eight rooms through our Service at the same
        property for the same dates. If you book more than eight rooms in
        separate reservations, we may cancel your bookings. We may also charge a
        cancellation fee, and any non-refundable deposit you paid may be
        forfeited. If you wish to book more than eight rooms, please use the
        “Groups and Meetings” section of our Service. You may be required to
        sign a written contract or pay a non-refundable deposit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ratings</strong>
        <br />
        The ratings displayed through our Service indicate the level and type of
        features you can expect at the property (where applicable) and may be
        provided by local and national star rating organizations. These ratings
        may differ from the standards in your own country. The ratings displayed
        on the site are not guaranteed for any specific feature or amenity.
        Additional information is available in the “Overview” or “Amenities”
        section of the property details page. These guidelines are subject to
        change, and our Group Companies and Partners cannot guarantee the
        accuracy of any specific rating displayed through our Service from time
        to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Meals</strong>
        <br />
        If meals are included as part of your accommodation booking, the number
        of meals provided is based on the number of nights of your stay. Full
        board usually includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Half board usually
        includes breakfast and lunch or dinner. No refunds are provided if one
        or more meals are not consumed.
      </p>

      <h3>B. Vrbo Vacation Rentals</h3>
      <p>
        If you book a vacation rental property distributed by Vrbo or its brands
        (Stayz, Bookabach, FeWo Direkt, and Abritel) through our Service, it is
        referred to as a “Vrbo Vacation Rental.” The Vrbo terms and conditions
        provided at the time of payment and booking of the Vrbo Vacation Rental
        apply.
      </p>

      <h3>C. Linked Travel Arrangements</h3>
      <p>
        A “Linked Travel Arrangement” has the same meaning as defined in the
        European Parliament and Council Directive 2015/2302 on package travel
        and linked travel arrangements, as applicable under national law
        (“Directive (EU) 2015/2302”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In certain situations and depending on the Travel Services offered from
        time to time, a Linked Travel Arrangement may arise when you decide to
        book through our Service. When this possibility arises, you will be
        asked to read the following important information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you book additional Travel Services for your trip or holiday via our
        Service after selecting and paying for one Travel Service, you will not
        benefit from the rights applying to packages under Directive (EU)
        2015/2302. Therefore, we will not be responsible for the proper
        performance of those additional Travel Services. In case of problems,
        please contact the relevant Travel Provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you book an additional Travel Service (such as a car rental)
        via a link on the confirmation page or Booking Confirmation within 24
        hours after receiving confirmation of a property booking, these travel
        services will become part of a Linked Travel Arrangement. In this case,
        we have protection in place to refund your payments for services not
        performed due to our insolvency, as required by EU law. Please note that
        if payments are made directly to the relevant Travel Provider, we will
        not provide any protection to refund you in case of the Travel
        Provider's insolvency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>More information on insolvency protection:</strong>
        <br />
        We have taken out insolvency protection with Liberty Mutual Insurance
        Europe SE (5-7 rue Léon Laval, L-3372 Leudelange, Luxembourg). Travelers
        may contact this entity in case services are denied due to our
        insolvency (Tel: +31 103120666 email:
        Insolvency-claims@ipplondon.co.uk).
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: This insolvency protection does not cover contracts with other
        parties which, despite our insolvency, can be fulfilled.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-6 text-4xl" >Section 7: International Travel</h2>
      <p>
        While most travel goes smoothly, some destinations may involve more risk
        than others. Before booking international travel, you should review the
        travel advisories issued by the relevant governments. You should also
        monitor these travel advisories during your trip and before your return
        journey and take necessary precautions to avoid and minimize potential
        disruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warnings, entry requirements, and travel advisory information on certain
        international destinations can be found here. You are responsible for
        being aware of and complying with any applicable recommendations,
        restrictions, and entry requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Health</strong>
        <br />
        You should check recommended vaccinations/immunizations, as these can
        change. Consult your doctor before your trip. Your responsibilities
        include:
        <ul>
          <li>Meeting all health entry requirements</li>
          <li>Obtaining relevant/necessary vaccinations/immunizations</li>
          <li>Taking any recommended medications, and</li>
          <li>Complying with all medical advice related to your trip.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Online medical advice for travelers can be found here. Otherwise,
        consult your doctor for medical advice related to your journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Passports and Visas</strong>
        <br />
        You should contact the relevant Embassy or Consulate for passport and
        visa information. Requirements may change, so check the most current
        information and allow adequate time for all necessary applications
        before booking and traveling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Group Companies are not liable for your refusal to enter any country
        or board any flight or ship (if applicable). This includes all aircraft
        or ship stops (if applicable), even if you do not leave the plane or
        airport or the ship.
      </p>
      <p>Passport: You must have a valid passport for all holidays.</p>
      <p>
        Some overseas countries have immigration requirements that require your
        passport to be valid for a minimum period after entry into that country,
        typically six months. If your passport is in its final year, check your
        destination's requirements before finalizing your travel plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name on the passport must match the name on the ticket; otherwise,
        you may not be able to travel and your insurance may be invalid. If any
        party member's name changes (e.g., due to marriage, etc.) after booking
        a Travel Service but before traveling, you must inform us.
      </p>
      <p>For more information, visit here.</p>
      <p>
        Visa: For visa requirements, contact the Embassy or Consulate of the
        country you plan to visit and, if applicable, the Embassy or Consulate
        of the country to which you intend to return if you are not a citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some governments require airlines to provide personal information about
        all passengers on their aircraft. These data will be collected at
        check-in at the airport or, in some cases, when you make your booking.
        For any questions about this, contact the relevant airline you will be
        traveling with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Group Companies do not represent or warrant that travel to
        international destinations is advisable or without risk and are not
        liable for any damages or losses resulting from travel to such
        destinations.

      <h2 className="my-6 text-4xl" >Section 8: Liability</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Liability for Travel Services</strong>
        <br />
        Travel Providers provide the Travel Services to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where Expedia Travel is the Travel Provider, to the maximum extent
        permitted by law and subject to the exclusions and limitations in these
        Terms or the relevant Rules and Restrictions, Expedia Travel will be
        liable only for direct:

            damages that are reasonably foreseeable by both you and Expedia
            Travel,

            Travel Services,
          </li>

        and Expedia Travel's liability in relation to any Travel Service will,
        in any event, be limited to the cost you paid to Expedia Travel for the
        relevant Travel Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The liability of other Travel Providers to you will be as set out in the
        relevant Rules and Restrictions. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
        where Expedia Travel is not the Travel Provider, Expedia Travel will not
        be liable to you for any Travel Services provided by other Travel
        Providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our Liability</strong>
        <br />
        We operate our Service, and the Travel Providers provide the Travel
        Services to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our Partners will not be

        The display of Travel Services through our Service does not constitute

        To the maximum extent permitted by law and subject to the limitations in
        these Terms, neither our Group Companies nor our Partners will be liable

        Companies and Partners have been advised of the possibility of such
        damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we are found liable for any liability under these Terms or for any
        loss or damage under these Terms, then to the maximum extent permitted

        and our liability in total will not exceed the greater of (a) the cost
        you paid for the relevant Travel Service or (b) one hundred dollars
        (100.00 $) or the equivalent amount in your local currency.
      </p>
      <p>
        This limitation of liability reflects the allocation of risks between
        you and us. The limitations specified in this Section will survive even
        if any limited remedy specified in these Terms is found to have failed

        <strong>Traveler Support and Handling of Complaints</strong>
        <br />
        We are here to help if you have any questions or complaints about your
        booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visit our Support page to get answers to commonly asked questions or
        contact us via the chat function.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you experience any issues with your booked Travel Service, we will
        assist you in resolving the problem if you make a complaint or have a
        right to compensation from the Travel Provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever possible, please report any issues with the Travel Service you
        booked to us or the relevant Travel Provider before or during your trip.
        This allows us to address the issue promptly and mitigate any damage you
        may suffer. If you do not report the problem during or before your trip,
        you may miss the opportunity to have the issue reviewed and rectified
        while on vacation. This could impact your rights under these Terms,
        potentially leading to a reduction in compensation, potentially to zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you encounter any issues with the booked Travel Service (e.g., the
        problem occurred during the inbound journey), please contact us or the
        relevant Travel Provider as soon as possible after your trip. It is
        recommended to submit your complaints within 30 days after your trip.

        <br />
        Unless otherwise specified, the prices displayed do not include travel
        insurance. It is recommended that you take out travel insurance, which

        <strong>Non-Enforcement</strong>
        <br />

        provision in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Severability</strong>
        <br />
        If any provision (or part of a provision) of these Terms is found by a
        court of competent jurisdiction or other competent authority to be
        invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision (or part) will be
        treated as if it were not included in these Terms. In such a case, the
        validity and enforceability of the other provisions of these Terms will
        not be affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Entire Agreement</strong>
        <br />

      <p>
        <strong>Third-Party Rights</strong>
        <br />
        We do not intend for any part of these Terms to be enforceable by any
        person not a party to these Terms. No consent from any third party is
        required to waive, amend, or terminate any part of these Terms. These
        Terms do not confer any rights under any applicable law or regulation
        concerning any part of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Survival of Obligations</strong>
        <br />
        Any provision of these Terms that explicitly or by its nature imposes
        obligations beyond the expiration or termination of these Terms will
        survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.
